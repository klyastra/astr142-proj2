# Step 1: get the HUDF images in 3 filters.
# The original press release image (https://science.nasa.gov/asset/hubble/hubble-ultra-deep-field-image-reveals-galaxies-galore/)
# states that the ACS/WFC instrument took the HUDF images between Sep 2003 and Jan 2004.
# NASA description says HUDF images come from proposal 9978: 
# https://mast.stsci.edu/search/ui/#/hst/results?proposal_id=9978
# We'll choose the following files:
## J8M802020 - F606W (green --> BLUE), 81.0 min exptime, 2003-09-25 20:09:20 UT
## J8M803020 - F775W (red --> GREEN), 81.0 min exptime, 2003-09-27 00:57:17 UT
## J8M804020 - F814W (IR --> RED), 81.0 min exptime, 2003-09-27 18:10:20 UT
# We'll get the calibrated files in DRC format
# Each DRC-calibrated file has an HDUList containing the science image (0), and uncertainty stuff (1 and 2).
